# OKX Credit Score Protocol - Smart Contracts

Solidity smart contracts for the OKX Credit Score Protocol, enabling decentralized credit scoring based on OKX DEX trading history and uncollateralized lending.

## Overview

The smart contracts consist of two core components that work together to provide credit-based lending in DeFi:

1. **CreditScore.sol** - Stores and calculates user credit scores based on OKX trading data
2. **SimpleLending.sol** - Provides uncollateralized loans based on credit scores

Built with Solidity 0.8.20 and deployed using the Foundry framework for maximum security and gas efficiency.

## Features

- üè¶ **Credit Score Management** - Onchain storage and calculation of user credit ratings
- üí∞ **Uncollateralized Lending** - Borrow funds based purely on credit score
- üîê **Oracle Integration** - Secure data feeds from OKX DEX API
- ‚ö° **Gas Optimized** - Efficient storage patterns and minimal computation
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security First** - Comprehensive access controls and validation
- üìä **Transparent Scoring** - Public scoring algorithm for fairness

## Contract Architecture

### CreditScore Contract

**Purpose**: Manages user credit scores based on OKX trading data

**Key Functions**:

- `updateUserData(address, uint256, uint256)` - Oracle updates user trading data
- `calculateScore(uint256, uint256)` - Pure function for score calculation
- `getScore(address)` - View user's current credit score

**Scoring Algorithm**:

```
Base Score (200 points) + Volume Score (0-500) + Trade Count Score (0-300) = Total (200-1000)

Volume Score: $1,000 trading volume = 50 points (capped at 500)
Trade Count Score: 1 trade = 3 points (capped at 300)
Maximum Score: 1,000 points
```

### SimpleLending Contract

**Purpose**: Provides uncollateralized loans based on credit scores

**Key Functions**:

- `borrow()` - Request loan based on credit score
- `repay()` - Repay outstanding loan
- `deposit()` - Add liquidity to lending pool

**Lending Terms**:

- **Minimum Score**: 300 points required to borrow
- **Credit Limit**: Credit Score √ó $10 USD
- **Loan Amount**: 50% of credit limit (conservative approach)
- **Duration**: 30 days
- **Interest**: 0% for MVP (can be extended)

## Contract Details

### CreditScore.sol

```solidity
// State Variables
mapping(address => uint256) public scores;           // User credit scores
mapping(address => uint256) public tradingVolume;   // OKX trading volume
mapping(address => uint256) public tradeCount;      // Number of trades
address public oracle;                              // Authorized data updater

// Key Functions
function updateUserData(address user, uint256 volume, uint256 count) external onlyOracle
function calculateScore(uint256 volume, uint256 count) public pure returns (uint256)
function getScore(address user) external view returns (uint256)
```

**Events**:

- `ScoreUpdated(address indexed user, uint256 score)` - Credit score updated

### SimpleLending.sol

```solidity
// State Variables
ICreditScore public creditScore;                     // Credit score contract reference
mapping(address => Loan) public loans;              // User loans
uint256 public constant MIN_SCORE = 300;           // Minimum score to borrow
uint256 public constant LOAN_DURATION = 30 days;   // Loan term

// Loan Structure
struct Loan {
    uint256 amount;    // Loan amount in USD (6 decimals)
    uint256 dueDate;   // Repayment deadline
    bool repaid;       // Repayment status
}

// Key Functions
function borrow() external                           // Request loan
function repay() external payable                   // Repay loan
function deposit() external payable                 // Add liquidity
```

**Events**:

- `LoanIssued(address indexed borrower, uint256 amount)` - Loan disbursed
- `LoanRepaid(address indexed borrower, uint256 amount)` - Loan repaid

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run with verbosity
forge test -vvv

# Run specific test file
forge test --match-path test/CreditScore.t.sol

# Gas reporting
forge test --gas-report
```

### Test Coverage

```bash
# Generate coverage report
forge coverage
```

### Integration Tests

The contracts are designed to work together:

1. **Oracle updates credit score** via `CreditScore.updateUserData()`
2. **User borrows funds** via `SimpleLending.borrow()`
3. **Lending contract queries** credit score via `CreditScore.getScore()`
4. **Loan issued** based on calculated credit limit

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- **Oracle Role**: Only designated oracle can update credit scores
- **Owner Role**: Only owner can withdraw liquidity from lending contract

### Input Validation

- Address zero checks for all user inputs
- Overflow protection with Solidity 0.8.20
- Loan existence and repayment status validation

### Economic Security

- Conservative loan-to-value ratio (50% of credit limit)
- Minimum credit score requirement (300 points)
- Fixed ETH price for MVP (upgradeable for production)

### Known Limitations

- **Fixed ETH Price**: Uses constant $3,000/ETH (needs oracle for production)
- **No Interest**: 0% interest for MVP demonstration
- **Simple Scoring**: Basic algorithm (can be enhanced with ML)

## Gas Optimization

- **Packed Structs**: Loan struct uses optimal packing
- **View Functions**: Scoring calculation is `pure` for gas efficiency
- **Minimal Storage**: Only essential data stored onchain
- **Batch Operations**: Future versions could support batch updates

## Deployment Addresses

Contract addresses are stored in `DEPLOYED_ADDRESSES.md` after deployment.
